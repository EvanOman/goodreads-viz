A bit basic but I think it is a good mainstream-friendly book which takes the capability / impact of GenAI seriously.

A good introduction but a bit surface level in the second half. It has definitely improved my mental model for how spark is operating under the hood.

The first half was very interesting, the second half was a disaster.I didn't find the author's situation very sympathetic and then, after slogging thr The first half was very interesting, the second half was a disaster.I didn't find the author's situation very sympathetic and then, after slogging through chapters of limbo, he completely skimps out on the details of the resolution. He tries to cover by saying "sometimes in trading you don't know why you're right" but he \_chose\_ to write this book, convinced me to buy it, and then let me down by not delivering on what was promised.Really wish I had just stopped halfway. ...more

review

A great blow-by-blow account of the audacious early days of Nike that ends with a fantastic afterward bringing it all together. Knight has his flaws, A great blow-by-blow account of the audacious early days of Nike that ends with a fantastic afterward bringing it all together. Knight has his flaws, but overall I was pretty impressed with his introspection and philosophy toward life.Some favorite takeaways / quotes:- “The cowards never started and the weak died along the way. That leaves us, ladies and gentlemen. Us."- Never stop learning or growing; be a professor of the jungle- "What if there were a way, without being an athlete, to feel what athletes feel? To play all the time, instead of working? Or else to enjoy work so much that it becomes essentially the same thing."- Money is like blood flowing through the cardiovascular system. The purpose of that system is to support human life and activity. Blood is essential for that purpose, but it is not the purpose in and of itself.- "Like books, sports give people a sense of having lived other lives, of taking part in other people's victories. And defeats. When sports are at their best, the spirit of the fan merges with the spirit of the athlete, and in that convergence, in that transference, is the oneness that the mystics talk about"- "I had an aching sense that our time is short, shorter than we ever know, short as a morning run, and I wanted mine to be meaningful. And purposeful. And creative. And important. Above all . . . different"- Hands off leadership, giving people a chance to solve problems on their own, rotating top people into different roles to push them out of their comfort zone and challenge them in new ways- His greatest satisfaction comes from all the personal relationships he has developed and the people he has helped with good shoes (think long and hard about who you want to spend time with and how you want to impact the world)- At the end of launching Nike, one of his biggest regrets was not being able to do it all over again ...more
